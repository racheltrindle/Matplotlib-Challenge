Laboratory

While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've since joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As their Chief Data Analyst, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.


*Scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
*Scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
*Scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
*Bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.



*Use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
*Use the Matplotlib library.
*Include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
*Proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, X and Y Axis Limits, etc.
*Scatter plots include error bars to allow the company to account for variability between mice.
*Bar graph indicates tumor growth as red and tumor reduction as green.
